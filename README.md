## Target:
0. Doing a hell of a Ph.D.
1. Learning to connect/ bind C, C++, CUDA and, Python.
2. Learning to properly debugging.
3. Efficiency; developing solutions for real-time/real-world applications.



## Rules:
Always think about what is the appropriiate way to do it.

0. Use Vibe coding for first prototype.
1. All functions must be prototyped in python. 
    1. If performance is necessary, after trying with python go for other better implementation.

2. Source file with appropriate comments must be implemented in ./src appropriate folder.

3. Common mistakes and important feature should be mentioned in ./doc/notes/#.md

4. Maximum 2 layers of overthinking 

5. Don't adopt newest version of the framework. Stay one stable version behind.
    1. Unless it provides a feature that is needed.

6. In programming, line length is often dictated by style guides, such as [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python, which suggests a limit of 79 characters. 

7. we’re going to always take the “less code” route when not obviously wrong
