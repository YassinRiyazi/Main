## Target:
0. Doing a hell of a Ph.D.
1. Learning to connect/ bind C, C++, CUDA and, Python.
2. Learning to properly debug.
3. Efficiency, developing solutions for real-time/real-world applications.



## Rules:
1. All functions must be prototyped in python. 
    1. If performance is necessary, after trying with python go for other better implementation.

2. Source file with appropriate comments must be implemented in ./src appropriate folder.

3. Common mistakes and important feature should be mentioned in ./doc/notes/#.md

4. Maximum 2 layers of overthinking 

5. Don't adopt newest version of the framework. Stay one stable version behind.
    1. Unless it provides a feature that is needed.
