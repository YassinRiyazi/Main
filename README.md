# Main
Use this repo to 
1. organize 
2. document 
3. store 
all my effort during my journey. 

For documentation please visit [Here](https://yassinriyazi.github.io/Main/).

##Target:
0. Doing a hell of a Ph.D.
1. Learning to connect/ bind C, C++, CUDA and, Python.
2. Learning to debug them.
3. Efficiency, developing solutions for real time applications.

### Documentation:
Use simple HTML docs for each function. 
Automatically extract docs and put it in HTML, but manually add tags and hyperlinks, Or maybe add it inside help and parse it later.


## Rules:
1. All functions must be prototyped in python. 
1. 1. If performance is necessary, after trying with python go for other better implementation.

2. Source file with appropriate comments must be implemented in ./src appropriate folder.

3. Common mistakes and important feature should be mentioned in ./doc/notes/#.md

4.
