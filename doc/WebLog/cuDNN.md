## [NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN)](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/latest/)

cuDNN is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks. It provides highly tuned implementations of operations arising frequently in deep neural network (DNN) applications.

- Scaled dot-product attention
- Convolution, including cross-correlation
- Matrix multiplication
- Normalizations, softmax, and pooling
- Arithmetic, mathematical, relational, and logical pointwise operations

API layers are available for constructing these graphs:
- Python frontend API
- C++ frontend API
- C backend API
