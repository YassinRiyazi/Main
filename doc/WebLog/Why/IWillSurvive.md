## My ystory
I had many conversation with my parents. And I consider my self very close to them, but due to geopolitical situation there is constant fear of loosing them. They may killed by government, foreign countries, earth quakes, and unavailability of water.

I hate my country. 

During Israel-Iran war my father send me his will. It was terrible. I remember one of the unhealthy way of reconciling with this fact was to assume my parents are diseased, and sometimes I think how cruel can I be.

I discussed this with them to find a way. My father said the same thing. Image the worst thin. Survive and grow. 

I hope that my parent live a happy and long life, but I promise to keep my self alive in even worst conditions and cherish all seconds of my life to go toward a greater version of my self. A version who help the world to be a better place.
