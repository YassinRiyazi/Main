I'm a PhD student in mechanical engineer.
My question is what do you recommend to improve my skills. In future I want to solve real frontier world problem whither in industry or acadidemia

During my masters degree I had some courses about control and Deep learning. I have familiarity with python, pytorch.
my thesis was about predicting a chaotic dynamical system with help of the Koopman operator, deeplearning numerical implementation. 

For my Ph.d, till now I have worked on estimating fluid properties from high speed video footage and trained neural networks, LSTM and transformer. 

 thesis i'm planning to learning C and C++ to write enterprise program that connect lab instruments to gather data, do raytracing and with help of RL reconstruct 3d shape from light source reflection, make a 3d reconstruction of surface from a drop probing the surface.

Problems I have already encountered:
Python being slow, no real multi-threading
lack of Distributing tasks between computers.
some relevant github repositories are in C and C++.














What about learning assembly?
---------------------------------------------------
Assembly is nice to know at a basic level, but not essential for your industry goals.
If you like, I can propose a tiny assembly + C project to satisfy your curiosity without going down a rabbit hole.

❓ Assembly is usually not required for:
    High-level C/C++ applications that interact with instruments over serial, TCP/IP, USB, etc.
    Most industrial control, automation, or data acquisition systems
    AI/ML integration or deployment

🧠 Learning some assembly can be useful if:
    You’re working on embedded systems with very tight resource constraints (e.g., microcontrollers with a few KB of RAM).
    You want to deeply understand how C/C++ code translates to machine instructions (e.g., for performance optimization, debugging weird low-level bugs).
    You’re writing device drivers, firmware, or RTOS kernels.

🏭 Industry relevance
    ➡ In most industry jobs — including robotics, automation, aerospace, automotive — assembly is not required for 95% of engineering work.
    ➡ Knowing about assembly (e.g., how the stack works, registers, calling conventions) helps you write better C/C++ and debug performance.
    ➡ Only a small subset of embedded/firmware or ultra low-level hardware jobs will expect actual assembly programming skills.

🚀 What I recommend
    ✅ Learn just enough assembly to:
        Understand how your C/C++ code maps to machine instructions (e.g., inspect disassembly in gdb or with objdump)
        Understand stack frames, registers, calling conventions
        Recognize bottlenecks in performance-critical code

    ✅ Focus your time on:
        C/C++ mastery (you’ll get 10x the ROI for your target goals)
        Embedded C if needed (for closer-to-hardware tasks)

    🎯 If you want to explore assembly:
        Pick x86-64 or ARM assembly (depending on your target platform)
        Build small experiments: e.g., write a function in assembly, call it from C
        Learn to read compiler output (gcc -S)

👉 Good resources:
    PC Assembly Language by Paul A. Carter (free PDF)
    Godbolt Compiler Explorer (online tool to see C/C++ → assembly)












What about CUDA?
---------------------------------------------------
➡ CUDA is good to have if you aim for roles with heavy GPU computing (robotics vision, automotive ADAS, simulation-heavy roles).
➡ Not essential for typical data acquisition / control jobs unless those involve high-speed processing that CPUs can’t handle.

You will work on real-time or near real-time AI inference on NVIDIA GPUs (robotics vision, autonomous systems, manufacturing vision inspection, etc.)
You’re doing heavy simulations (e.g., physics, FEM, fluid dynamics) where GPU acceleration gives huge speedups
You want to work in industries where NVIDIA GPUs are standard (e.g., robotics, automotive ADAS, aerospace, medical imaging)

✅ A deep understanding of how to design parallel algorithms

💡 If your target jobs are in robotics, automotive, aerospace — and they mention GPU programming, CUDA is a great skill.
💡 If not, your time might be better spent mastering C++, system design, comms protocols, or AI deployment frameworks (ONNX, TensorRT — these use CUDA behind the scenes, but shield you from writing CUDA code).
📝 My recommendation
    ✅ Learn CUDA basics — understand how GPU kernels work, how threads/blocks/grid are structured.
    ✅ Build 1 mini project: e.g., implement matrix multiplication or signal processing in CUDA to grasp concepts.
    ✅ Focus more on using GPU-accelerated tools unless you know you’ll need custom CUDA kernels.

🌟 Alternative to full CUDA dive
    Learn TensorRT / ONNX Runtime to deploy AI models on GPUs efficiently (industry cares about this!)
    Use CuPy (Python library that’s NumPy-compatible but runs on CUDA) if you want to explore GPU acceleration with low overhead











Do you recommend learning Fortran?
---------------------------------------------------
Fortran isn’t needed for your target industry roles in control, AI, or enterprise data acquisition.
But knowing how to interface with Fortran can be handy if you end up near legacy simulation systems.

👉 Learning Fortran well takes time.

👉 In modern industry, you'd more likely:
    Interface to existing Fortran libraries using C/C++ or Python
    Call optimized Fortran code from your main application
    Rarely write lots of new Fortran code

👉 In most industry jobs (even in aerospace, automotive, robotics):
    ➡ You’ll use C/C++, Python, or modern high-performance frameworks (CUDA, OpenMP, MPI).
    ➡ Fortran will be "good to understand" if working near legacy code.

✅ My recommendation
    ➡ Learn what Fortran is, how to interoperate with it (e.g., calling Fortran from C/Python)
    ➡ No need to spend time mastering Fortran syntax or writing new Fortran code unless you’re sure you’ll join a simulation-heavy org using it
    ➡ Focus your time on C++, Python, AI deployment, software engineering best practices, performance optimization (e.g., OpenMP, CUDA if needed)

🌟 If you’re curious
If you do want to explore:
    Write a small Fortran routine (e.g. matrix multiply or ODE solver)
    Call it from C or Python (using f2py or C bindings)
    See how Fortran integrates with modern code











And what about Adobe after effect and blender for presenting my work?
---------------------------------------------------
✅ After Effects (AE) — Great for:
    Creating polished, dynamic animations (diagrams, system block models, data visualizations)
    Motion graphics that explain complex concepts clearly
    Adding professional effects to video recordings of simulations or experiments

✅ Blender — Great for:
    3D modeling of components, assemblies, experimental setups
    Simulating and rendering realistic scenes (e.g., robotics arm, machine, test rig)
    Animating mechanisms or processes

✅ If you're curious:
    Spend a few hours learning Blender basics (there are many free YouTube tutorials; it’s great for engineering scenes)
    Consider DaVinci Resolve as an alternative to After Effects — also powerful and there’s a good free version

✅ Focus on:
    Telling a clear story with your visuals (even a simple clean 2D animation can be very effective)
    Automating data-driven animations (Python + Manim, Matplotlib, or Plotly sometimes gets you 80% of the way with less effort)

✅ If you want:
    I can help you design a presentation pipeline (e.g. data → animation → final video) that fits your goals
    Suggest beginner-friendly Blender or AE tutorials for engineers











Do you recommend learning GDB?
---------------------------------------------------
I strongly recommend learning GDB (the GNU Debugger)

⏳ Time investment?
    You can get comfortable with basic GDB in a weekend.
    Use it regularly — every time you have a bug, step into GDB instead of adding print statements.
    You'll level up fast and impress teammates during code reviews or incident resolution.

✅ GDB helps you:
    Find and fix segmentation faults, memory bugs, and crashes
    Step through code line by line, inspect variables, control flow, and function calls
    Analyze core dumps (post-mortem debugging)
    Debug multithreaded programs or interactions with hardware/drivers
    Set conditional breakpoints, watchpoints (monitor memory), or reverse-step (with rr)

🧪 In your specific use case (lab instruments, enterprise C/C++ software):
    If you’re reading from sensors, parsing binary protocols, or using drivers — a segfault or memory issue is inevitable.
    GDB will let you debug even when you can’t easily "print" things (e.g., driver crashes, low-level bugs).
    Bonus: You can attach GDB to a running process if a service or daemon misbehaves.

🧰 Recommended GDB skills to learn
    ✅ Basics:
        break, run, next, step, print, backtrace, continue
        
    ✅ Intermediate:
        Conditional breakpoints: break if x > 5
        Watchpoints: watch *ptr
        Inspect memory/registers: x, info registers
    
    ✅ Advanced:
        Debugging core dumps: gdb ./a.out core
        Using TUI mode: gdb -tui
        Remote debugging: GDB server / gdbstub (great for embedded/hardware targets)

🛠 Tools that work well with GDB
    Valgrind:
        memory leak detector + works with GDB

    GDB GUI frontends:
        VSCode with GDB debugger plugin
        gdb-dashboard (for a prettier CLI interface)
        cgdb or gdb -tui (text UI)

For windows debugging GDB is not the best but still works. Figure it out when you get there.
For CUDA can use CUDA-GDB.











what project do you recommend I implement by hand to get better with C and C++?

Do you recommend that I learn IPC interpreters communication 
---------------------------------------------------
🧪 1. Lab Instrument Integration
    You mentioned you're developing software to connect lab instruments. Many instruments:
        Run on separate processes, devices, or even systems
        Need communication via sockets, shared memory, or serial protocols
        Sometimes expose APIs via Python, C, or shell interpreters

        🔧 IPC (e.g., pipes, shared memory, sockets) is essential for managing these data streams efficiently and safely.

🧠 2. Bridging C/C++ Simulators with Python/AI Tools
    You’re working in AI + control + simulation. In practice:
        AI models (PyTorch) often live in Python
        Simulations or real-time systems (C/C++) need to send/receive data
        You’ll need fast, low-latency data exchange

        ⚡ IPC lets you avoid writing monolithic applications and enables you to combine the best tools for each job.

💻 3. Enterprise & Industry Use Cases
    In real-world engineering software:
        GUI runs in one process, back-end in another
        You communicate between real-time systems, hardware drivers, user interfaces, etc.
        IPC is fundamental for multi-process safety, performance, and modular design

For the fluid simulator, is it a good idea to implement it with CUDA, C and C++ and also adding a wrapper for python for debugging purposes?
---------------------------------------------------
Yes — that is not just a good idea, it’s a strategically excellent architecture for your fluid simulator, especially given your PhD goals and future interest in industry. Here's a breakdown of why this is smart and how to structure it.
✅ Why This Is a Great Architecture
1. CUDA for Performance
    Fluid simulation is computationally expensive (especially in 3D).
    CUDA enables massive parallelism for:
        Advection, diffusion, projection steps
        Pressure solvers (e.g. Jacobi, multigrid, PCG)
        Particle systems or semi-Lagrangian steps
    You get GPU-accelerated performance, which is critical for real-time or high-res sims.

2. C/C++ for Core Infrastructure
    C/C++ gives you:
        Fine control over memory and performance
        Strong numerical libraries (Eigen, cuBLAS, etc.)
        Easier debugging than CUDA-only
    Acts as the main simulation engine layer

3. Python Wrapper for Debugging and Flexibility
    Python makes testing, debugging, and visualization easier:
        Plotting with matplotlib, 3D visualization with PyVista or mayavi
        Fast integration with Jupyter notebooks
    Allows AI and ML workflows to interact with your simulator (e.g. reinforcement learning or control)
    🔧 Your Python wrapper becomes a live interface to test your engine — change parameters, run steps, visualize, all without recompiling.

🔄 How to Structure It

/simulator/
├── src/
│   ├── main.cu / .cpp        # Core CUDA/C++ simulation logic
│   ├── solver.cu             # Pressure solver, advection, etc.
│   ├── grid.h / .cpp         # Data structures
│   └── interface.cpp         # Exposed interface functions
├── python/
│   ├── simulator.py          # Pybind11 wrapper
│   └── tests/
├── include/
│   └── *.h                   # Shared headers
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── examples/

    Use pybind11 to expose C++ and CUDA entry points to Python.
    Keep CUDA kernels modular and callable from C++.
    Build with CMake, set up build targets for both native use and Python module (like a wheel or shared lib).

🧪 Example Workflow
    Write a 3D fluid simulation step in CUDA.
    Expose step_simulation() and get_velocity_field() in C++.
    Wrap them with pybind11 into FluidSim Python class.
 
    In Jupyter:
    sim = FluidSim(resolution=(64,64,64))
    sim.step()
    u, v, w = sim.get_velocity_field()
    pyvista.plot_vector_field(u, v, w)

🔍 Debugging Benefits
Without Python	With Python Wrapper
Recompile for every param change	Adjust viscosity, dt, etc. on the fly
Hard to plot internal state	Use matplotlib, PyVista, VTK
Cumbersome integration testing	Write fast unit/integration tests in Python
🛠️ Libraries to Help

    pybind11 – best for C++/Python interface

    Thrust – CUDA STL-like utilities

    cuBLAS or Eigen – for solving linear systems

    PyVista, matplotlib, ParaView – for visualization

    Catch2, doctest – for C++ unit testing

🧠 TL;DR: Why It’s the Right Move
Element	Why It's Ideal for You
CUDA	High-performance simulation core
C++	Infrastructure, structure, flexibility
Python	Debugging, prototyping, ML/AI bridge
Interop	Positions you for research + industry work
Modularity	Enables future expansion (GUI, visualization, AI agent control)

If you'd like, I can scaffold a starter template with:

    CUDA/C++ advection kernel

    pybind11 interface

    Python test and visualization script

Would that be useful to you?











I have intermediate knowledge in Python, and used Python for Ai programming. 
Based on the information of this chat.

    Anything that doesn’t help with performance, engineering, or AI+simulation integration.










Do you recommend me to learn Javascript?
---------------------------------------------------
Vibe code for now
---------------------------------------------------
🟡 Best Alternative: Learn Just Enough JavaScript to Use Existing Tools
    You could learn:
        Basic JS syntax
        How to use Plotly.js, Three.js, or React for simple frontends
        How to embed Python/C++ results into web views using frameworks like:
            Dash (Python backend, JS frontend)
            Streamlit
            Jupyter + Voilà

This way, you don't go deep into JS, but use it strategically to expose your work.


Learning JavaScript is worth considering, but whether you should depends on your goals. Here's a tailored breakdown based on your background and ambitions:
✅ You Should Learn JavaScript If…
1. You Want to Build Frontends for Your Simulations
    JS is the lingua franca of the web.

    You could build:
        Interactive dashboards for simulation results (e.g. using Three.js or Plotly.js)
        Web-based UIs to control your simulator
        Visualization tools that combine physics + AI output

    🧠 Example: Visualizing fluid dynamics or control systems in 3D on a browser.

2. You Plan to Package Research for Industry or Broader Impact
    Web apps are widely accessible and cross-platform.
    JS + WebGL lets you create demos for investors, collaborators, or users without installing software.

    🧠 Example: Imagine your CUDA-powered simulator has a Python backend + web interface to tweak parameters live and visualize effects.

3. You May Work in Robotics / Simulation Platforms (e.g., ROS dashboards, digital twins)
    Many cloud robotics/industrial systems offer web-based visualization and control panels.
    JavaScript (with frameworks like React + D3.js) is used to build real-time control panels.

❌ Skip Learning JS (For Now) If...
    Your focus is on numerical performance, physics modeling, or deep system programming.
    You're not planning to build tools that require user interaction, cloud-based delivery, or visual dashboards.
    You're already stretched learning CUDA, C++, AI, etc. (which are far more relevant for hardcore simulation work).










Do you recommend me to learn GO?
---------------------------------------------------
Halt
---------------------------------------------------
✅ Learn Go later if you're planning to work on tools, servers, or real-world deployments of your AI/simulation tech.
❌ Skip for now if you're still climbing the mountain of C++/CUDA and want to master simulation + AI backend development.

✅ Reasons You Should Learn Go
    1. You Plan to Work in Cloud Systems or Industrial Platforms
        Go dominates in cloud infrastructure, IoT backends, and instrument control services (e.g., telemetry collectors, device managers).
        It’s used by companies like Google, Uber, Docker, Cloudflare, and HashiCorp.
        📦 Great for: building microservices, REST APIs, device data pipelines, or simulation control layers.

    2. You Want Simpler Alternatives to C++ for Concurrency
        Go's concurrency model (goroutines, channels) is clean and lightweight.
        Easier to write safe concurrent code compared to C++ or even Python async.
        💡 Ideal for real-time sensor data handling, robotic coordination, or CFD/AI simulation orchestration.

    3. You Might Build or Maintain Infrastructure Tools
        If you ever write tools for:
            Code generation
            Simulation runners
            Distributed pipelines
            Internal CLIs or servers
            Go is excellent for those.

❌ Reasons You Might Not Need Go (Right Now)
    1. You’re Deep into Numerical Computing / HPC / CUDA
        Go is not designed for high-performance computing:
            No GPU support
            No SIMD
            Weak numerical libraries compared to C++/Python

        If your projects center on simulation, CFD, or GPU acceleration, Go adds little value.

    2. You’re Still Investing in Core C++/CUDA/Ast/AI Skills
        If you're juggling CUDA, C++, Python, and numerical physics already, adding Go now may be distracting — especially since its use cases don't overlap directly.
