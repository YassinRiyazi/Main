## AlgoViz

TODO: 
visualize a set of point. Basically a Graph made from the topics I know, related and planing to learn.
I hae seen in one of *The Coding Sloth* youtube videos he recommend one interesting programming work is to visualize the algorithms and lets start with my data structure and real problem. 

Look at the images inside this folder


I'm very optimistic about this project. I remember when I was wanting to learn mathematical concepts. I wanted to index it my self. But I couldn't. My first attempt to learn HTML was at that time. 

So if one way of looking at it, if I could teach it to me it should has a structure that is meaning full and maybe AGI can benefit from it.
