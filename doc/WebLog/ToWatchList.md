    Terrence Andrew Davis (December 15, 1969 â€“ August 11, 2018)
    Arizona State University (BS, MS)
    He knew assembly.
    TempleOS included the design of its original programming language, editor, compiler and kernel, and it ultimately had over 120,000 lines of code.
    And over 12 years, he built his own operating system, writing over 100,000 lines of code, because he believed that God told him to.
    With 100,000-120,000 lines of code you can have a kernel, video processing, grep, games.
    640x480 16bit, single audio channel.
