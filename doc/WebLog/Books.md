## Suggested Reading Order
1. A Tour of C++ – builds the foundation quickly
    Why: Best modern C++ overview, concise but complete (C++11–17).
    Covers classes, templates, smart pointers, and STL fundamentals – everything you need for clean design in your raytracer and parser.
    Read first, then go deeper with Effective C++ and STL books.
2. Effective C++ – learn best practices
    Why: Shows you how to write clean, bug-free, performant code with idiomatic C++.
    Covers memory management, resource handling, class design, operator overloading, and more – critical for a raytracer engine.
3. Effective STL – master STL containers for parser/raytracer
    Why: The parser tool will involve containers, iterators, and algorithms heavily.
    Helps you avoid STL pitfalls and teaches performance-conscious patterns for maps, vectors, strings, etc.
4. Design Patterns (GoF) – structure components properly
    Why: The parser/doc tool is essentially a framework, not a small project.
    This book is about modularization, dependencies, and layering in large C++ codebases – invaluable for your tool.
5. Large-Scale C++ Software Design – for the parser/doc framework
    Why: The raytracer and parser will benefit from patterns like Visitor, Factory, Composite, Observer.
    The parser in particular will require AST visitors and extensible components – this book will help you design those cleanly.
6. (Optional) C Traps and Pitfalls for low-level pitfalls
    Great for understanding subtle C mistakes, but less critical if you focus on modern C++.
7. The C Programming Language (K&R)
    Classic reference; good if you want to deepen raw C fundamentals. But "A Tour of C++" and "Effective C++" are higher priority.


Not Needed for Now (for These Projects)
    CUDA / GPU Books (Programming Massively Parallel Processors, Professional CUDA C Programming): These are more relevant for CFD solvers or GPU-accelerated projects, not a CPU-based raytracer or parser.

    Parallel Programming (MPI, Patterns): Parallelization is not your primary bottleneck yet; get your single-threaded implementations working first.

    Introductory C Books (The Joy of C, Problem Solving and Program Design in C, The Art of C Programming): You’re past this level.
