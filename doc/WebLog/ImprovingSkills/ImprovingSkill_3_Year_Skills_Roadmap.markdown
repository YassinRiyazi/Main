# 3-Year Skills Development Roadmap for Mechanical Engineering PhD

## Overview
This roadmap is tailored for a PhD student in mechanical engineering, focusing on fluid dynamics, inverse problems, and 3D reconstruction. It leverages existing skills in Python, PyTorch, and basic C/C++ to tackle performance optimization, distributed computing, and integration with existing codebases. The plan spans 3 years, divided into six-month phases that progressively build programming, parallel computing, and domain-specific expertise. It supports three PhD projects:
- **Fluid property estimation** from high-speed video on known substrates
- **3D droplet-shape inference** via reinforcement learning (RL)
- **3D substrate reconstruction** using liquid probing techniques
