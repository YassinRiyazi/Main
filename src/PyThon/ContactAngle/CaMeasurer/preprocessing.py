def check_and_save_color_images(folder_path):
    """
    Check images in a folder and ensure they are saved as 3-channel color images.

    This function scans a given folder for image files and verifies if each image 
    is a 3-channel color image (BGR). If an image has fewer channels (e.g., grayscale), 
    it is converted to a 3-channel BGR format and saved in place.

    Parameters:
        folder_path (str): The path to the folder containing image files.

    Raises:
        None

    Example:
        >>> check_and_save_color_images("images/")

    Caution:
        Only image files with extensions '.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', or '.bmp' 
        will be processed. Non-image files are ignored.

    Notes:
        - Images that are already in color format will be left unmodified.
        - The function prints messages for missing folders, failed reads, and conversions.

    See Also:
        - `cv2.imread`: Used for reading images.
        - `cv2.cvtColor`: Used to convert grayscale to BGR.
        - `cv2.imwrite`: Used to overwrite the original image with the new one.

    Warning:
        This function overwrites original grayscale images with their color-converted versions.

def make_folders(ad):
    """
    Create two subfolders 'SR_edge' and 'SR_result' inside the given directory.

    If either folder already exists, it is deleted and recreated to ensure a clean directory.

    Parameters:
        ad (str): The path to the parent directory where subfolders will be created.

    Raises:
        None

    Example:
        >>> make_folders("/path/to/project")

    Caution:
        This function will **delete** existing 'SR_edge' and 'SR_result' folders 
        along with all their contents, if they already exist.

    Notes:
        - The folders created are:
            - 'SR_edge': Typically used to store edge detection outputs.
            - 'SR_result': Typically used to store final super-resolution results.
        - Uses `shutil.rmtree()` to forcefully delete existing directories before recreating.

    See Also:
        - `os.makedirs`: For creating directories.
        - `shutil.rmtree`: For removing directories and their contents.

    Warning:
        Any existing data in 'SR_edge' and 'SR_result' will be permanently lost if present.
